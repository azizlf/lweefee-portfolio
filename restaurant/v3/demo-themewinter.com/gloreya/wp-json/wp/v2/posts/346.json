Part of the joy of the Instant Pot is that there\u2019s no guessing.

Instant Pots are great because everyone\u2019s is the same and when you say, cook on high pressure for 5 minutes, the results are going to be the same. The only thing that will possibly be different is seasoning, which should be, because you should always season to taste. And speaking of seasoning to taste, all of the recipes in this Instant Pot series are 5 ingredients, not counting salt and pepper.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019re cooking a meal, especially a holiday meal, to be served to friends or family, the key to success is planning.
