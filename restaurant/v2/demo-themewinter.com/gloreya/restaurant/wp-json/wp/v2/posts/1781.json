Part of the joy of the Instant Pot is that there\u2019s no guessing. With regular cooking, everyone\u2019s idea of medium high heat is different and when you factor in what kind of pan you\u2019re using and whether or not you have a gas or electric range means that there are a lot of variables. Instant Pots are great because everyone\u2019s is the same and when you say, cook on high pressure for 5 minutes, the results are going to be the same. The only thing that will possibly be different is seasoning, which should be, because you should always season to taste. And speaking of seasoning to taste, all of the recipes in this Instant Pot series are 5 ingredients, not counting salt and pepper.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019re cooking a meal, especially a holiday meal, to be served to friends or family, the key to success is planning.
